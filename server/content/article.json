		"body": "<p>If you\u2019re usually office-bound, Christmas is the perfect time to take advantage of the pleasures of a daytime nap. For those like me, who work from home, taking a nap whenever you like is one of the few things that makes home working worthwhile, alongside the short commute, \u2018relaxed\u2019 dress code and colleagues not sidling up to your desk and asking if they can \u201Cborrow you for a minute?\u2019. And let me tell you, I\u2019m very, very good at napping.<\/p>\r\n<p>For me, a daytime nap is one of the most civilised distractions ever invented.<\/p>\r\n<p>It\u2019s what made renowned afternoon dozers like Leonardo Da Vinci and Albert Einstein the geniuses they were. It\u2019s why sports legends like Muhammad Ali and Usain Bolt rewrote the record books. And why Benjamin Franklin and JFK became political visionaries. And probably why Donald <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/men\/the-filter\/donald-trumps-four-hours-night-extreme-sleeping-habits-leaders\/\">\u201CNo naps for Trump! I don\u2019t nap!\u201D <\/a>Trump didn\u2019t.<\/p>\r\n<p>Me? I look to another famous day sleeper for my inspiration, Sir Winston Churchill. A vehement proponent of the afternoon nap, Churchill believed that it wasn\u2019t nature\u2019s design for mankind to work all day \u201Cwithout the refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts 20 minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces.\u201D I\u2019m not saying we wouldn\u2019t have won the Second World War if Churchill hadn\u2019t been a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/health\/news\/11831863\/A-nap-a-day-could-save-your-life-research-suggests.html\">napper<\/a>but you have to wonder, not least because Adolf Hitler was the polar opposite, a night owl fond of late-night cake binges and indecently long lie-ins.<\/p>\r\n<p>Science is certainly on mine and Churchill\u2019s side.William Dement, founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/med.stanford.edu\/sleepdivision.html\">Stanford University\u2019s Sleep Research Center<\/a> and perhaps the world\u2019s leading authority on sleep, argues that human beings have merely learned to limit their sleep to one period of the day, despite the overwhelming majority of mammals sleeping in short spells instead. It\u2019s his belief that humans were designed to sleep in the middle of the day, primarily as a way to get them out of the midday sun, and that the very fact we still all tire in the afternoon, especially as you hit middle-age, shows us that we\u2019re actually just fighting a natural instinct not to snooze, armed only with strong coffee and snacks.<\/p>",
